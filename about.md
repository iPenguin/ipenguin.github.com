I've known I wanted to work with computers as a profession since I was 13 years old. 
I learned about Linux in high school and I've been using it continuously since 1999.
<br />
<br />
Since 2005 I've concentrated on programming. 
First working on an internal web application for a small local insurance company, 
then on databases for a company that created custom software for business clients, 
For almost three years I wrote and sold a piece of software for a niche market.
At my current job I'm working on the internal web application used to run order management, and customer service.
