I've known I wanted to work with computers as a profession since I was 13 years old. 
I learned about Linux in high school and I've been using it continuously since 1999.
<br />
<br />
Since 2005 I've concentrated on programming. 
First working on an internal web application for a small local insurance company, 
then on databases for a custom software company, 
and finally for myself creating specialized graphics design software for crochet designers.
